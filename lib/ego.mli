(** Ego is an extensible egraph library for OCaml. The interface to
   Ego is loosely based on the Rust's egg library and reimplements

    {{:#top}Ego} provides two interfaces to its equality saturation
    engine:
    
    1. {!Ego.Basic} - an out-of-the-box interface to pure equality
    saturation (i.e supporting only syntactic rewrites).

    2. {!Ego.Generic} - a higher order interface to equality saturation,
    parameterised over custom-user defined analyses.

    3. {!Ego.Implication} - based on the Ego.Basic module with additional
    support for implication formulas
