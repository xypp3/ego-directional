(*
      We start off with two exprs, (g 1) and (g 2), and merge these two.
      Then we add a rule (g ?a) -> (h ?a), creating (h 1) and (h 2) which are also equal to (g 1) and (g 2).
      We extract the cheapest term using a cost function constructed such that (h 2) is lowest cost term, with cost 11.
      Previously (h 1), which has cost 12, was extracted instead.

      (h 1): 12
      (h 2): 11
      (g 1): inf
      (g 2): inf
